# Home pager/alarm system

This system is primarily intended to facilitate reliable communication between the bedroom and living room.

# Components

## The bedroom pager

A device in the bedroom that can be easily manipulated - a touch or shake should be all that is required to signal the pager. 

Additional controls should operate the lights in the bedroom.

## The living room alarm

A device in the rec room to be mounted on top of a monitor. It drives lights and a speaker to alert the user. It should have a touch or button that provides a feedback acknowledgement to the pager unit.

# PC software

A Windows program that can listen for pager events, and provide a windows message. This could be provided via slack or discord.

# Android software

A smartphone app that can be paged as well. This could, again, be provided via slack or discord, but it must override the DoNotDisturb setting.
